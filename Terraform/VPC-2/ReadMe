count - The number of identical resources to create. 
Above you can see I have used count parameter to create two subnets.
I could have said count = 2, but what if in the future I wanted another subnet in the third AZ. That's why I have used length function with count.

length determines the length of a given list, map, or string.
In our case, length of the variable called"azs"  is 2 (eu-west-2a and eu-west-2a), so two subnets are created.
If I add one more AZ to the list then count will become 3 and three subnets will be created.

Element retrieves a single element from a list. In our example, we have a variable called prod-intra-subnets with two subnets (list).
We need to provide these subnet CIDRs one by one while creating a subnet. By using element function,
I'm instructing Terraform to pick the subnet CIDR one by one in a loop.

Let's take a look at the NAT Gateway tag, for "tag Name", I am using ${count.index} otherwise I will have a same tag for all resources.
I have used count.index to get the index of each “iteration” in the “loop”.
